#Welcome to the Distributed Computing Large Lab repository!

Distributed Grid Scheduler, is a grid computing system allowing multiple users to submit independent jobs to multiple clusters, where job requests are performed in a given amount of time. Developed with AWS Java SDK and deployed on 100 t2.micro Amazon EC2 instances. 

Conducted variety of experiments on the system in order to test Scalability, Fault Tolerant, Load Balancing and Consistency.

This is the code for the IN4391 Distributed Computing Systems course at TU Delft.

Libraries used are:

- [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/) for communication with Amazon Web Services
- [JSCH](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/) for SSH via Java

Java 1.8 is used to compile and run the code and the IDE used is Eclipse.
